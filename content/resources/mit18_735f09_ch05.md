description: Lecture notes on parabolic induction, restriction functors for rational
  Cherednik algebras, a geometric approach to rational Cherednik algebras, completion
  of rational Cherednik algebras, the duality functor, generalized Jacquet functors,
  the centralizer construction, completion of rational Cherednik algebras at arbitrary
  points of h/G, the completion functor, parabolic induction and restriction functors
  for rational Cherednik algebras, some evaluations of the parabolic induction and
  restriction functors, dependence of the functor Resb on b, and supports of modules.
